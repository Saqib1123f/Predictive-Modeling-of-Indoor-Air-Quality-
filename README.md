# Predictive-Modeling-of-Indoor-Air-Quality-
Predictive modeling of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) refers to the use of data-driven and mathematical techniques to forecast the concentration of air pollutants and environmental conditions inside buildings.
Poor indoor air quality is associated with:

Respiratory diseases (asthma, COPD)

Allergies and irritation (eyes, throat, skin)

Headaches and fatigue

Reduced cognitive performance

Common indoor air pollutants include:

CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide) – indicator of ventilation effectiveness

PM2.5 / PM10 – fine particulate matter


CO (Carbon Monoxide)

Temperature & Humidity – affect pollutant behavior and comfort
